# tribute-page
I built this tribute page to demonstrate knowledge of semantic HTML, CSS, responsive web design, and accessibility, as well as to honor a legend of boxing. I completed the freeCodeCamp project "Build a Tribute Page" with the code that I wrote here. I intended for this project to prove my mastery of concepts taught by the freeCodeCamp curriculum.
